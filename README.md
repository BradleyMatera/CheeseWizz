# üßÄ CheeseWizz Project

## üìù Overview

The **CheeseWizz** project is a comprehensive cheese database application designed to manage and retrieve detailed information about various cheeses, origins, tastes, and related cheeses. This project incorporates advanced search functionalities, dynamic query logic, and seamless frontend-backend integration. The application is built with a focus on flexibility, modularity, and efficiency, ensuring users can easily access and interact with the data.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîç Comprehensive Search Functionality

- **Advanced Query Logic with MongoDB**  
  Utilizes MongoDB's `$or` operator to enable logical OR queries across multiple fields, providing flexible and comprehensive search capabilities.

- **Regular Expression Integration**  
  Enables case-insensitive searches and converts spaces in search terms into logical OR conditions (`|`) for more dynamic querying across different fields.

- **Dynamic Search Criteria Builder**  
  A search criteria function dynamically generates query conditions based on the provided search term and selected field, enhancing modularity and reusability.

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend Controllers & Collection Management

- **Unified Get-All Functionality**  
  Implemented across all controllers to ensure consistent behavior when retrieving data from different collections (cheeses, origins, tastes, related cheeses).

- **Collection-Specific Queries**  
  Each controller efficiently handles collection-specific queries, ensuring accurate data retrieval and processing.

### üíª Frontend Integration

- **Modular Search Bar Component**  
  A dynamic search bar allows users to select a collection and enter search terms, interacting seamlessly with the backend.

- **Get-All Feature**  
  Fetches all documents from the selected collection when no specific search term is provided, allowing users to access comprehensive data effortlessly.

### üîß Technological Enhancements

- **Advanced MongoDB Querying Methods**  
  Implemented complex query structures using MongoDB's `$or` operator to search across multiple fields within collections. Regular expressions (`RegExp`) were integrated to handle case-insensitive searches and dynamic query building, enabling users to search for terms across various document fields, such as names, origins, tastes, and related cheeses.

- **Dynamic Search Functionality**  
  Developed a reusable search criteria builder function, which dynamically constructs search queries based on user input. This approach supports flexible querying by converting search terms into logical OR conditions, allowing the system to return results that match any of the criteria specified by the user.

- **Modular Code Structuring**  
  Refined the application's architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability. This involved separating concerns across distinct controllers and models for cheeses, origins, tastes, and related cheeses. Each controller now manages its respective collection with consistent logic for CRUD operations and search functionalities, leading to easier updates and testing.

- **Extensive Debugging and Optimization**  
  Addressed and resolved critical issues such as improper API responses and JSON parsing errors. Enhanced the application's performance by streamlining data retrieval processes, reducing response times, and ensuring that all search operations return accurate and relevant results. Regular testing and debugging sessions were conducted to verify the integrity and efficiency of the entire codebase.

### üé® Visual Enhancements

- **Custom Shader Background**  
  Implemented a visually appealing shader background using Three.js and React Three Fiber, providing an immersive and dynamic user experience.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Utilized Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI design, ensuring a consistent look across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Shader System Details

The CheeseWizz project implements a visually appealing shader background using Three.js and React Three Fiber. This creates an immersive and dynamic user experience. The shader system consists of several key components:

##### Fragment Shader (`FragmentShader.jsx`)

The fragment shader is responsible for rendering the starry plane effect. It includes:

- **Uniforms**: `uTime` and `iResolution` for time and resolution.
- **Constants**: Various values like `pi`, `tau`, `planeDist`, `furthest`, and `fadeFrom`.
- **Functions**: 
  - `aces_approx`: Approximates ACES tone mapping.
  - `offset`, `doffset`, `ddoffset`: Calculate plane offsets.
  - `alphaBlend`: Blends colors based on alpha values.
  - `pmin`, `pmax`, `pabs`: Smooth minimum, maximum, and absolute value calculations.
  - `star5`: Calculates distance to a 5-pointed star shape.
  - `palette`: Generates color palettes.
  - `plane`: Calculates plane color and alpha.
  - `color`: Main function for fragment color calculation.

##### Star Shader (`StarShader.jsx`)

Sets up the Three.js scene and applies the custom shader material:

- Uses `shaderMaterial` from `@react-three/drei`.
- Updates `uTime` uniform on each frame.
- Renders `ShaderPlane` inside a full-viewport `Canvas`.

##### Shader Background (`ShaderBackground.jsx`)

Similar to `StarShader.jsx`, but used specifically for the background effect:

- Updates `uTime` uniform on each frame.
- Renders `ShaderPlane` in a full-viewport `Canvas`.

##### Custom Shader Material (`CustomShaderMaterial.jsx`)

Creates a custom shader material:

- Uses `shaderMaterial` from `@react-three/drei`.
- Imports vertex and fragment shaders.
- Sets the material to be transparent.

##### Vertex Shader (`VertexShader.jsx`)

Transforms the vertices of the plane geometry:

- Passes UV coordinates to the fragment shader.
- Transforms vertex positions using projection and model-view matrices.

These shader components work together to create a dynamic, starry background effect that enhances the visual appeal of the CheeseWizz application.
